I revisited nand2tetris after some time and repeadted this challenge.

## run

```bash
npm install //install node_modules

nodemon -x "npm test || exit 1"
```

this will rerun the test on every save and show the first occuerence in

## learnings

I strictly followed the API given on slide 114 ff.
Further, since the outcome was given, I used a test based approach, where each change would trigger a series of tests and show exactly, where my output differed from the desired output.
